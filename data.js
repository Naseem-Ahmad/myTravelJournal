        text: "The London Bridge is a historic river crossing over the River Thames, connecting central London to Southwark. The current bridge opened in 1973, replacing several older versions dating back to Roman times. Often confused with the more decorative Tower Bridge, London Bridge is simpler in design but holds great historical and strategic importance. It remains a key route for both vehicles and pedestrians in the city."
